### Hands on Google Big Table and its use-cases

#### What is Big Tables?

Bigtable is a distributed storage system for managing structured data that is designed to scale to a very large size: petabytes of data across thousands of commodity servers. Many projects at Google store data in Bigtable, including web indexing, Google Earth, and Google Finance. 

##### Quick Start

* Account on Google Cloud Computing Platform
* Tutorials: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-bigtable-intro-java/index.html
* Download Big Table Simulator / Setup Hbase database
* https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/emulator
* Few Commands to Play with Big Table Simulator

```
gcloud beta emulators bigtable start --host-port=127.0.0.1:8622 &
$(gcloud beta emulators bigtable env-init)
Now use cbt to connect to the simulator
```

Quick Start with cbt command line tool
https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/quickstart-cbt

Configure ~/.cbtrc

```
cbt. Commands 
 cbt createtable tech_talk
 cbt ls
 cbt ls tech_talk
 cbt createfamily tech_talk ad
 cbt ls tech_talk
 cbt set tech_talk "1#day1#talk1" ad:ak="Industrial Automation" ad:jc="Big Tables"
 cbt ls tech_talk ad
 cbt read tech_talk
 cbt read tech_talk prefix=1#da
 cbt set tech_talk "1#month#talk1" ad:ak="Industrial Automation" ad:jc="Big Tables"
 cbt read tech_talk prefix=1#da
 cbt read tech_talk prefix=1#
 cbt read tech_talk prefix=1# count=1
