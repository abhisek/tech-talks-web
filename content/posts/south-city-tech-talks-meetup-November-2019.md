### Relational Learning on Graphs

**Key Highlights**

* A brief history and Introduction to Knowledge Graph 
* Data in various domains can be modelled as Knowledge Graph. Some of the main applications of Knowledge Graphs are 
  * Recommendation Systems such as Amazon's one or Netflix for Videos
  * Fraud Detection
  * Anomaly Detection
* One of the emerging field is applying Machine Learning on Knowledge Graphs, called Relational Learning
* Demonstrated an important application of Knowledge Graphs and Relational Learning in improving Throughput of SOC (Security Operation Centre), where SOC Security Analyst works 24x7 to defend their network from hackers
* Following diagram shows, how Security Alerts were clustered together based on similarity and the system predicted malicious / benign score (red and colour) 
* The system uses variant of RESCAL library (mentioned in the references).
